/**
 * 
 * 
 * <p>
 * Convert an e-book from one format to another.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * input_file is the input and output_file is the output. Both must be specified
 * as the first two arguments to the command.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The output e-book format is guessed from the file extension of output_file.
 * output_file can also be of the special format .EXT where EXT is the output
 * file extension. In this case, the name of the output file is derived from the
 * name of the input file.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the filenames must not start with a hyphen. Finally, if output_file
 * has no extension, then it is treated as a directory and an “open e-book”
 * (OEB) consisting of HTML files is written to that directory. These files are
 * the files that would normally have been passed to the output plugin.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After specifying the input and output file you can customize the conversion
 * by specifying various options. The available options depend on the input and
 * output file types. To get help on them specify the input and output file and
 * then use the -h option.
 * </p>
